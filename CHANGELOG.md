## [2.0.1] - In progress

  (https://github.com/bmmalone/urlearning-cpp/issues/17) for more details.

## [2.0.0] - 2016-08-15
We consider the older C++ code as version 2 of URLearning. It is also no longer
maintained but [available](https://bitbucket.org/bmmalone/urlearning-cpp). The
newer 2.x.y code builds upon the same codebase, but it includes (or will
include) both infrastructure and functional upgrades.
