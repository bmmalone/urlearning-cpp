# URLearning

This c++ project implements a number of algorithms for learning Bayesian network
structures using state space search techniques. Please see the main
[urlearning](http://urlearning.org/) site for more details.

**The maintenance for this project is still in-progress. It is not considered stable,
and most of the programs do not yet run correctly.**

## Install

This project requires the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install.html)
build tool, as well as a standard development environment (gcc, etc.)

`make` is used build all of the solvers and associated programs.
